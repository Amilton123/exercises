\f0\fs24 \cf0 Feb. 10 Assignment \
\
I would go to an article data base on lets say ESPN.com and seek out if there are certain consistencies with players or coaches or information mentioned in articles each month. I would hope to determine that there are an X amount of articles referenecing LeBron James versus Y amount of someone else.\
\
I would create columns that would include the rank of the most occurred word, the percent it appears, the cumulative percent it appears, the word itself, and then track the names to see which occurred most. }
